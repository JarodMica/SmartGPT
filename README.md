# SmartGPT
An implemetation of "SmartGPT" as proposed by AI explained in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU&t=434s

## To run this
Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/JarodMica/SmartGPT.git```

Navigate into the repository folder and then set up the needed libraries. I recommend that you use a venv to do so and then run:
```pip install requirements.txt```

Setup your openai key in ```keys.yaml.example```. You will need to enter your own API key which can be found on openai's website @https://platform.openai.com/overview

## Some things to note
- [ ] Exact implementation may differ than that of what was discussed in Phillip's video.
